Z80~Ex

ZiLOG Z80 CPU emulator
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Features:

- precise opcode emulation (documented & undocumented)
- exact timings for each opcode (including I/O operations)
- full support for all interrupt modes
- allows simultaneous operation of several virtual CPUs
- written in pure ANSI C
- compiles as a library, which may be used via simple callback-based API


Building and installation (*):

for build using GNU C (GCC - unix, mingw/cygwin - Win32, DJGPP - DOS(**)),
type 'gmake'. static and shared libraries will appear in "./lib".
also you may do "gmake static" for building only static library,
or "gmake shared" for only shared library. 

after successful build, issue "gmake install" as superuser.
default install prefix is /usr/local, which can be changed in Makefile.

*)
support for non-GNU build methods is'nt included at the moment,
feel free to contribute :)

**)
when building with DJGPP, use "gmake static" -- DOS does'nt support
shared libraries


Usage:

include <z80ex.h> in your sources,
and link with "libz80ex" (-lz80ex).

no API documentation written yet, see comments in "z80ex.h".
